# UFOs

## Overview

Our client, Dana, has been researching UFO sightings and would like to share her findings with the world. She has collected data and summarized her findings. We have worked with her to create a dynamic website using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap. She requested that the data appear in a table that is easily sorted by using certain filters. 

## Results

We have created this dynamic website and have built filters for the following criteria: 
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

These filters can be used individually or together to further filter results. To use a filter, simply enter text into any of the filter boxes and then hit enter or click out of the box: 

Date filter example:

The data will remain sorted and you can add additional filters: 

Date and shape filter example:

Date, shape, and state filter example:

To clear the data, you have three main options: 
1. Delete the data from your filters
2. Go to the top of the page and click on the link that says “UFO Sightings” (see image below)
3. Refresh the page (see image below)

## Summary

One drawback of this website is that if you search for something that isn’t part of the data set, you will just see a blank table. One reason for this could be that the data does not exist, however another reason could be that you had a typo in your filter. For example, if you type “CA” in the state filter, nothing will appear. However if you correct this to “ca” then the data will filter appropriately. See below: 

Incorrect use of "ca"

Correct use of "ca"

Two recommendations are as follows: 
1. Dropdown filters added so that site visitors can see the available choices in each filter. This can help to prevent errors as listed above. 
2. A reset button near the filters so that site visitors can more easily refresh their filter choices.
